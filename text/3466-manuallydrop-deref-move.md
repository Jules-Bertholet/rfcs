- Feature Name: `manuallydrop_deref_move`
- Start Date: 2023-07-30
- RFC PR: [rust-lang/rfcs#3466](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3466)
- Rust Issue: [rust-lang/rust#0000](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/0000)

# Summary

Extend the special-case move-out-of-deref behavior of `Box<T>` to `ManuallyDrop<T>`. Additionally, allow partial moves out of a `T` stored inside `ManuallyDrop<T>` even when there is a `Drop` impl for `T`.

# Motivation

Often, instead of dropping a struct, one wants to move out of one of its fields. However, this is impossible to do in safe code when the struct implements  `Drop`, requiring use of `unsafe` APIs like `std::ptr::read`, or runtime-expensive workarounds like wrapping the field in an `Option` and using `take()`.

```rust
pub struct Foo(String);

impl Drop for Foo {
    fn drop(&mut self) { /* ... */ }
}

pub struct Bar(String);

impl Foo {
    pub fn into_bar(self) -> Bar {
        let m = core::mem::ManuallyDrop::new(foo);
        Bar(unsafe { core::ptr::read(&m.0) }) // Need to use `unsafe`
    }
}
```

I ran into this limitation while working on the [`async-lock` library](https://github.com/smol-rs/async-lock/blob/8045684f996b15b3dd9bfd621cfc3864d3760923/src/rwlock.rs#L879-L883). It has also been discussed elsewhere, including [this blog post from 2018](https://phaazon.net/blog/rust-no-drop) (which recommends `mem::uninitialized` as a workaround!) and [this pre-RFC on Internals](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-destructuring-values-that-impl-drop/10450).

# Explanation

In today's Rust, `Box<T>` has the unique capability that it is possible to move out of a dereference of it.

```rust
let b: Box<String> = Box::new("hello world".to_owned());
let s: String = *b; // `b`'s backing allocation is dropped here
```

Partial moves are also permitted.

```rust
let s: String;
{
    let b: Box<(String, String)> = Box::new(("hello".to_owned(), "world".to_owned()));
    s = b.1;
    // `b.0` and `b`'s backing allocation dropped here
}
```

This RFC extends this capability to `ManuallyDrop`.

```rust
use core::mem::ManuallyDrop;

let m: ManuallyDrop<(String, String)> = ManuallyDrop::new(("hello".to_owned(), "world".to_owned()));
drop(m.1); // `m.1` moved out of here
// `m.0` is never dropped
```

In addition, partial moves out of a `ManuallyDrop<T>`'s contents are allowed even when there is a `Drop` impl for `T`.

```rust
struct Foo(String, String);

impl Drop for Foo {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("down to the ground");
    }
}

let m: ManuallyDrop<Foo> = ManuallyDrop::new(Foo("hello".to_owned(), "world".to_owned()));
let s: String = m.1; // `m.1` moved out of here
// `m.0` is never dropped, and nothing is printed.
```

The example from the motivation section would be rewritten as:

```rust
impl Foo {
    fn into_bar(self) -> Bar {
        let m = core::mem::ManuallyDrop::new(foo);
        Bar(m.0)
    }
}
```

# Drawbacks

- Adds more "magic" to the language.
- This change would give safe Rust code a new capability (moving out of fields of `Drop`-implementing structs). It's theoretically possible that existing `unsafe` is relying on this capability not existing for soundness:

```rust
use core::hint::unreachable_unchecked;

/// If the bomb is dropped while armed,
/// it explodes and triggers undefined behavior.
pub struct Bomb {
    is_armed: bool,
}

impl Drop for Bomb {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        if self.is_armed {
            println!("ðŸ’¥ BOOM ðŸ’¥");

            // SAFETY: the only way for arbitrary safe code to obtain a `Bomb`
            // is via `DefuseWrapper::new()`. Because `DefuseWrapper` implements `Drop`,
            // it is impossible to move the `Bomb` out of it.
            // `DefuseWrapper`'s destructor ensures that
            // `is_armed` is set to `false` before the `Bomb` is dropped,
            // so this branch is unreachable.
            unsafe { unreachable_unchecked(); }
        }
    }
}

/// Disarms the bomb before dropping it.
pub struct DefuseWrapper {
    pub bomb: Bomb,
}

impl Drop for DefuseWrapper {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        self.bomb.is_armed = false;
    }
}

impl DefuseWrapper {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        DefuseWrapper {
            bomb: Bomb {
                is_armed: true,
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If code like the above example actually exists in the ecosystem, this proposal would make it unsound.

# Rationale and alternatives

- A more general mechanism for move-out-of-deref, which would subsume `Box`'s special-case support, has long been desired. There have been [three](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/178) [different](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1646) [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2439) attempting it, and extensive discussion going back to 2014. However, these proposals have all gone nowhere; finding a good design for this API seems to be a hard problem. Also, such an API would not subsume this RFC, as partial moves out of structs with `Drop` impls would still need hard-coded compiler support. In light of these facts, I think adding an existing lang-item type to an existing special case is justified while we wait for a more general `DerefMove`.
- It's possible that that such partial moves could be supported via a different API, such as an attribute (as suggested by the pre-RFC linked in the motivation section) or macro. However, move-out-of-deref is already familiar to Rust developers who have worked with `Box`, and `ManuallyDrop` is the recommended API for avoiding drop. Combining the two seems like the most minimal and intuitive solution.

# Prior art

This RFC addresses a problem unique to Rust's move and destructor semantics, so there is no analogue in other languages.

# Unresolved questions

None, as far as I am aware.

# Future possibilities

A more general `DerefMove` mechanism would be the natural next step, though it would not subsume this RFC, as explained in the [Rationale](#rationale-and-alternatives) section.
